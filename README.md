How this Pig Latin Translator works

* Rule 1: For words that begin with a consonant sound:

Take the initial consonant or consonant cluster of the word and move it to the end of the word.
  	Add "ay" to the end of the newly rearranged word.

Example:
"hello" becomes "ellohay".
"world" becomes "orldway".
"pig" becomes "igpay".
"glove" becomes "oveglay".
"school" becomes "oolschay".

* Rule 2: For words that begin with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u):

Simply add "way" or "yay" to the end of the word.

Example:
"apple" becomes "appleway"
"egg" becomes "eggyay"
"island" becomes "islandway"

* Rule 3: For words with capitalization:

Maintain the capitalization of the original word after it has been converted to Pig Latin.

Example:
"Hello" becomes "Ellohay"
"Apple" becomes "Appleway"

* Rule 4: For words with punctuation:

Move the punctuation to the end of the Pig Latin word.

Example:
"hello!" becomes "ellohay!"
"world," becomes "orldway,"

* This translator provides you the option to generate a random sentence and converts it to Pig Latin.
